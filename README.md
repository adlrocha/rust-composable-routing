# Rust Composable Routing
The goal of this repo is to start replicating th developments on composable routing and
smart records from the following repos while exploring the idea of WASM in the web3 stack:
- Smart records: https://github.com/libp2p/go-smart-record/
- Routing language: https://github.com/libp2p/go-routing-language

_Disclaimer: This repo is being used as an excuse to learn Rust, so any
instructive feedback is more than welcome._
